_Marknote_ is a fast, lightweight Javascript XML library that easily reads, traverses, and writes XML.

Use it to:

  * read XML from a string or URL
  * traverse and edit the XML DOM
  * generate XML
  * convert from XML to JSON or JSON to XML

_Marknote_ is intuitive, very easy to learn, and completely browser independent; it works consistently and identically in every modern browser.
